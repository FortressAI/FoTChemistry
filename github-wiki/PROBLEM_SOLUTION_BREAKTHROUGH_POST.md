# 🎯 BREAKTHROUGH: FoTChemistry Problem-Solution Dashboard

## **Finding the Needles in the Molecular Haystack**

We've just launched something unprecedented in computational chemistry: a **Problem-Solution Dashboard** that can instantly tell you **which of our 6,443 molecular discoveries solve specific real-world chemistry problems**.

### **🚨 THE PROBLEM WE SOLVED**

Traditional molecular discovery generates thousands of compounds, but answers the wrong question:

❌ **"What properties does this molecule have?"**  
✅ **"Which molecules solve my specific problem?"**
