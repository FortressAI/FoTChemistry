## 🎯 **CORE PRINCIPLES: NO LIES, NO SIMULATIONS**

**SCIENTIFICALLY RIGOROUS** protein folding analysis for therapeutic discovery.

- **✅ NO LIES, NO SIMULATIONS, NO FAKE RESULTS**
- **✅ Built-in quality validation at every step**  
- **✅ Real physics-based analysis only**
- **✅ If nothing valid is found, we report nothing**
- **✅ Complete transparency about limitations**

---

## 🧪 **HONEST SCIENTIFIC APPROACH**

This framework prioritizes **scientific integrity** over false claims:

### ✅ **What We Actually Do:**
- Generate scientifically realistic protein sequences
- Perform rigorous physics-based folding simulations
- Validate all results against known experimental data
- Report only discoveries that pass strict validation criteria
- Provide complete methodology and limitation transparency

### ❌ **What We DON'T Do:**
- Generate random sequences and call them "discoveries"
- Create fake physics simulations
- Report results without experimental validation
- Hide limitations or uncertainties
- Make exaggerated therapeutic claims
