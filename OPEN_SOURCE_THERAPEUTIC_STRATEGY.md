- Genentech licenses your platform to discover autoimmune targets
- They keep their specific discoveries private if they want
- Your platform generates revenue without monopolizing biological building blocks

### **2. Therapeutic Development Services**
**Revenue Stream:** Consulting and development services using your discoveries

- **Computational Validation:** $50K-500K per candidate
- **Experimental Design:** $100K-1M per therapeutic program  
- **Clinical Translation Support:** $1M-10M per drug program
- **Manufacturing Optimization:** $500K-5M per production line

### **3. Research Collaborations & Grants**
**Revenue Stream:** Academic and government funding for open research

- **NIH/NSF Grants:** $1M-50M for open therapeutic research
- **Gates Foundation:** $10M-100M for global health applications
- **EU Horizon Program:** ‚Ç¨5M-50M for open innovation projects
