# Protein Folding Legacy Archive

This directory contains legacy files from the previous FoTProteinFolding project that was transformed into FoTChemistry on **September 28, 2025**.

## Transformation Summary

- **Previous**: Field of Truth (FoT) Protein Folding Framework
- **Current**: FoTChemistry - Open Lab Notebook & Truth Ledger for Chemistry
- **Migration Date**: 2025-09-28

## Archived Files

### Core Protein Files
- `protein_folding_analysis.py` - Main protein folding analysis engine
- `fot_protein_folding_spec.md` - Original protein folding specification
- `streamlit_protein_dashboard.py` - Protein discovery dashboard
- `fot_protein_ontology.ttl` - Protein-specific ontology

### Data and Exports
- `streamlit_dashboard/` - Complete protein discovery dashboard with 237K+ discoveries
- `csv-exports/` - Protein discovery exports and Neo4j data dumps
- `export_protein_discoveries.py` - Protein data export scripts

### Documentation
- `linkedin_post_quantum_protein_discovery.md` - Social media posts about protein discoveries

## Why Archived?

These files were **NOT deleted** because they represent:
- **Significant scientific work**: 237,895+ protein discoveries with quantum analysis
- **Valuable methodology**: vQbit quantum state representations and truth-mining workflows
- **Prior art documentation**: Complete IP trail for protein folding methodology
- **Knowledge preservation**: Field of Truth principles applied to protein science

## Potential Future Use

The protein folding work could be:
- **Revived as a separate project** if there's demand for protein-specific FoT applications
- **Referenced for methodology** - the truth-mining and validation approaches are domain-agnostic
- **Integrated later** - proteins are chemicals too, and could be brought back into FoTChemistry scope
- **Cited in publications** - the quantum protein work represents novel scientific contributions

## Transformation Rationale

**Why Chemistry over Proteins?**
1. **Broader impact**: Chemistry encompasses proteins plus small molecules, materials, reactions
2. **Better tooling**: RDKit, Psi4, OpenMM provide rich chemistry ecosystems
3. **Active community**: More open chemistry datasets and validation opportunities  
4. **Clearer scope**: Well-defined problems like reaction yield prediction, property estimation
5. **Safety considerations**: Chemistry ethics and safety frameworks are more mature

## Key Preserved Concepts

The following FoT concepts were preserved in the transformation:
- **Truth-mining workflows**: Agents propose → validate → collapse claims
- **vQbit quantum representations**: Quantum-enhanced state representations 
- **No simulations rule**: All results must be computationally real
- **Agentic Knowledge Graphs**: Autonomous agents operating on graph databases
- **Ethics and safety**: Built-in safety validation and dual-use screening
- **Open science defaults**: FAIR data, reproducible compute, Zenodo archiving
