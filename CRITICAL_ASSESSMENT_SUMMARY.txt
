üö® CRITICAL SCIENTIFIC ASSESSMENT - RESULTS INVALID

Based on expert review, our computational results show fundamental errors:

‚ùå STRUCTURAL PREDICTION FAILURES:
- 52.4% Œ±-helix content (should be <10% for AŒ≤42)
- Missing 60-80% disordered content (experimentally established)
- Impossible structure combination (95% structured vs. known disorder)

‚ùå THERAPEUTIC CLAIMS RETRACTED:
- 'Beta-sheet aggregation sites' based on incorrect structural model
- Drug targets derived from non-physiological conformations
- All therapeutic discoveries are SCIENTIFICALLY INVALID

‚úÖ REQUIRED ACTIONS:
1. Acknowledge systematic structural prediction errors
2. Retract all therapeutic target claims
3. Fix force field parameterization problems  
4. Validate against experimental NMR/CD data
5. Implement proper disorder sampling

CONCLUSION: Computational method requires fundamental revision.
Current results unsuitable for publication or clinical translation.
Scientific integrity demands honest assessment of these failures.
