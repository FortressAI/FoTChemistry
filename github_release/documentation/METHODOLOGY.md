# Methodology: Physics-Accurate Therapeutic Discovery

## Overview

The Field of Truth (FoT) framework combines quantum-inspired mathematics with rigorous molecular mechanics to identify therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease with unprecedented accuracy.

## Core Components

### 1. Physics Validation Framework

**Energy Validation:**
- Range: -15 to 5 kcal/mol per residue (physiological range)
- Thermodynamic consistency: ΔG = -RT ln(K)
- Boltzmann statistics validation
- Energy conservation checks

**Structural Validation:**
- Secondary structure normalization (Σ = 1.0 ± 0.05)
- Ramachandran plot compliance (>95% allowed regions)
- Clash detection and resolution
- Realistic bond geometries

**Quantum Consistency:**
- vQbit probability normalization
- Unitary evolution operators
- Amplitude conservation
- Measurement operator validation

### 2. Therapeutic Assessment

**Pathological Indicators:**
- β-sheet propensity (amyloid formation risk)
- Protein instability scoring
- Aggregation propensity analysis
- Hydrophobic clustering assessment

**Druggability Analysis:**
- Structured region accessibility
- Aromatic residue content (binding sites)
- Charged residue distribution (selectivity)
- Surface area calculations

### 3. Novelty Assessment

**Sequence Comparison:**
- Exact match detection against known pathological proteins
- Similarity scoring (>80% identity threshold)
- Patent database cross-reference
- Literature validation

**Research Value Scoring:**
- Physics validation weight: 25%
- Therapeutic potential weight: 30%
- Druggability weight: 20%
- Confidence level weight: 15%
- Aggregation propensity weight: 10%
