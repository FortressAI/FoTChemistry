## 🔬 Scientific Framework

### **Truth Claims Structure**
Each contribution must include:

```json
{
  "@type": "PFASTreatmentClaim",
  "treatment_method": "electrochemical_defluorination",
  "pfas_compounds": ["PFOA", "PFOS", "PFNA"],
  "initial_concentration": {"value": 1000, "unit": "ng/L"},
  "final_concentration": {"value": 8.5, "unit": "ng/L"},
  "removal_efficiency": {"value": 99.15, "uncertainty": 0.3, "unit": "%"},
  "energy_consumption": {"value": 2.4, "unit": "kWh/m3"},
  "operating_conditions": {
    "temperature": {"value": 25, "unit": "celsius"},
    "pH": {"value": 7.2, "unit": "pH"},

  },
  "validation_status": "peer_reviewed",
  "replication_count": 3,
  "evidence": ["doi:10.1021/example", "field_test_data.csv"]
}
```

### **Required Validation**
- **Mass balance**: Input PFAS = Output PFAS + Mineralized products
- **Analytical verification**: LC-MS/MS with isotope-labeled standards
- **Interference testing**: Real water matrices (surface, ground, wastewater)
- **Regeneration validation**: Repeated cycle performance data
- **Safety assessment**: Byproduct identification and toxicity screening
